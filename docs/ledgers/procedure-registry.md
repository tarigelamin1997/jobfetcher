# Ledger · Procedure Registry

> A "procedure" is a reusable standard read *before* a recurring task (how we write a source adapter, a scoring prompt, a dbt model, etc.). The registry's invariant: **a referenced procedure is either `Written` or a `Deferred → <stage>` entry with an owning stage — never a dangling reference.** Right-sized for this project: most standards live inline in the docs below rather than as separate procedure files; this table is the index + status.

| Procedure | Status | Lives in / owned by |
|---|---|---|
| ADR authoring (with rejected alternatives) | ✅ Written | [adr/README](../adr/README.md) |
| Error/incident logging (Five Questions) | ✅ Written | [05-methodology](../05-methodology.md#adopt-cheap-high-leverage-even-solo--value-is-memory-across-time) + [errors.md](errors.md) |
| Validation-gate standard (behavioral + negative case) | ✅ Written | [05-methodology](../05-methodology.md) + applied in [04-v0-build-plan](../04-v0-build-plan.md) |
| Secrets management (Secrets Manager, `jobfetcher/<service>`) | ✅ Written | [decisions-locked](decisions-locked.md) (Security) · pattern in [`scripts/jsearch_probe.py`](../../scripts/jsearch_probe.py) `get_key()` |
| **Gate trio** (entry/code/exit) as slash-commands | ✅ Written | [`.claude/commands/`](../../.claude/commands/) (`start-step` · `review-step` · `close-step`) · [ADR-0013](../adr/0013-enforcement-gate-trio-branch-pr.md) |
| Data-contract / source normalization | 🟡 Started → v0 | `SearchSpec` ([scripts/search_spec.py](../../scripts/search_spec.py)) + the **dissection contract** `DissectedPosting`/`Skill` (`src/jobfetcher/core/models.py`, C-1); the posting/score contracts complete at Step 2 |
| Scoring-prompt standard (7-factor, explainable, temp 0) | 🔜 Deferred → v0 | authored in v0 Step 5 |
| Dissection-prompt standard (grounded, evidence-required, temp 0) | ✅ Written → v0 (C-1) | `src/jobfetcher/core/dissector.py` `DISSECTION_SYSTEM_PROMPT` + `grounding_check` |
| Persistence / `Repository` pattern (SQLAlchemy Core + aurora-data-api dialect; local-Postgres DB tests) | ✅ Written → v0 (C-2) | [ADR-0018](../adr/0018-persistence-sqlalchemy-data-api-repository.md) + [04-v0-build-plan](../04-v0-build-plan.md) Steps 1–2 |
| Migratability checklist (ports/adapters, flags, Alembic, additive TF) | ✅ Written | [03-roadmap](../03-roadmap.md#migratability-requirements-build-v0-so-the-above-stays-cheap) |
| Dedup / entity-resolution standard | 🔜 Deferred → M2 | authored when multi-source + dedup lands |
| CV-render standard (content model → DOCX + PDF; honesty rules) | 🔜 Deferred → M1 | authored when CV tailoring lands |
| dbt-modeling standard (staging→marts, tests, lineage, incremental) | 🔜 Deferred → M5 | authored when the analytics plane lands |
| Chaos / negative-injection (right-sized: targeted, not six-angle) | 🔜 Deferred → M7 | a couple of failure-injection tests on the riskiest path |

> When a deferred procedure's stage starts, **authoring it is the first step** of that stage. Keep this table honest — a `Deferred` entry with no owning stage is a bug.
